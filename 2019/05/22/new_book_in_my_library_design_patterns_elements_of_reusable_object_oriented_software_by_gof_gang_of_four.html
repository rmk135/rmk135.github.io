<h1>New book in My Library - Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by GoF - Gang of Four</h1>
<p>I’ve done with reading another great book about fundamentals of software engineering - Design
Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by GoF - Gang of Four - Erich Gamma,
Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51szD9HC9pL._SX395_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51szD9HC9pL._SX395_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51szD9HC9pL._SX395_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;" /></a>
<p>Amazon says that this book is #1 Best Seller in category “Software Reuse”. Could I miss it,
feeling so passionate about this topic? No way, friends, no way. I feel really happy that this
book has appeared on my bookshelf and I’m hurrying to share some feedback with you.</p>
<div id="more"> </div><p>–</p>
<p>My history with patterns goes back to 2012.</p>
<p>In 2012 I’ve had ~ 5 years of experience working with object-oriented paradigm and I was looking
for some answers about object-oriented design that I hadn’t slept well without. The way I’ve
faced the answers was a book for PHP programmers that contained classic GoF Design Patterns
catalog with examples written in PHP. I, unfortunately, don’t remember the name of the book and
its author, but it was rather good, and I’ve discovered object-oriented paradigm as a quite
different, quite more powerful tool. I remember that one of the great epiphanies was that
algorithms could be represented as objects. Strategy is still one of my favorite patterns…</p>
<p>So, I’ve been using object-oriented paradigm for 12 years, last 7 of them actively working with
patterns? Guess, have I found anything new in this book? - Of course, and a lot.</p>
<div class="section" id="about-the-book">
<h2>About the book</h2>
<p>#1 Best Seller in category “Software Reuse”?</p>
<p>Well, there are a lot of different opinions, but I think that this title is justified and deserved.</p>
<p>First, book is very well structured. Really cool thing is that each pattern is described
approximately on 10 pages. It’s quite convenient cause you could split the reading to minimal
blocks and do it whenever you feel comfortable. There is not need to book big time slots to stay
in context during reading big chapters.</p>
<p>Second, each pattern is described quite extensively and laconic at the same time. Pattern
description contains summary of the problem, solution, implementation issues and (what’s
very important) consequences. What I also liked a lot is that pattern implementation details
contain description of pattern variations - I often had a problem with some cases whether it was
a bit hard to identify if particular decision could still be qualified as a classic GoF pattern
or it’s something different. Good news, now I have answers.</p>
<p>Third, book answers fundamental questions - “What is pattern?”, “Why patterns are needed?”,
“What is the difference between object-oriented analysis and object-oriented design?”, “How to
use patterns right?”. First two chapters and conclusion are really doing great job on this field.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="recommendations">
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>I would recommend to read this book to all software engineers even not because it would be
beneficial for performance and career, but just because it’s kind of classic of software
engineering domain.</p>
<p>I’ve met a lot of people saying that they “Don’t like Patterns”. Most of the times they felt
hard to explain what exactly they don’t like…</p>
<p>I’ve also met a lot of people saying that “They already use all the Patterns (cause they are
experienced programmers)”. Most of the times they felt hard to explain what exactly they are
using and what are the consequences of such decisions…</p>
<p>I’ve also met a lot of people saying that “They’re not actual anymore (cause 25+ years past
since the book was written and Python is not Java / C++ / etc)”. Most of the times they felt hard
to explain what exactly is not actual and why patterns are not applicable to XYZ language…</p>
<p>As it was revealed during further conversations, such people just have very superficial
understanding of what Design Patterns are.</p>
<p>Don’t be like that. Make your opinion being grounded. Understand what exactly you don’t like and
why.</p>
<p>I’m a fan, but not a fanatic, of Design Patterns. I would recommend you to read GoF Design
Patterns in original to make your own impression. Like it or hate it? Decide after, with opened
eyes.</p>
