<p>Hey,</p>
<p>My name is Roman. I am a software engineer. I started this website to share
some of my professional experience in software engineering, interesting books,
and lifestyle events. I like high-load systems, domain-driven design, clean code,
refactoring, asynchronous programming, and generally everything about creating software.
My professional credo – “Done, when done well”. I like to make things work smart
and comprehensive way, at the same time being simple, clear, and well-structured.</p>
<div class="section" id="my-experience">
<h2>My Experience</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I am a software engineer with 14 years of commercial experience.</li>
<li>I specialize in engineering backend applications and reusable
libraries and frameworks.</li>
<li>I found and lead <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ets-labs">ETS Labs</a>. This is an engineering organization that specializes
in creating Python software.</li>
<li>I created the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ets-labs/python-dependency-injector">Dependency Injector</a>.
It’s a dependency injection framework for Python.
It has become one of the most popular Python dependency injection frameworks.</li>
<li>I mentor other software engineers helping to promote their careers, structure the knowledge,
and develop new skills. My partner and I created <a class="reference external" href="https://t.me/devmentorbot">MentorBot</a>.
It’s a Telegram bot that helps software engineers to find mentors.</li>
<li>I use Python as the main programming language. I also have some experience with
Cython and C. I also used PHP and Javascript at the beginning of my software
engineering career.</li>
<li>I have experience in technical leading software engineering
cross-functional teams for international product and service companies,
as well as experience working in a startup as a first backend engineer.</li>
<li>I worked as a technical interviewer and help companies to hire Python software engineers.
I have conducted over 250 technical interviews.</li>
<li>I like to read books about software engineering. My favorite authors are
Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Steve McConnell, Robert C. Martin, and other
known experts in the field of software design.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="my-career">
<h2>My Career</h2>
<p>I’ve been fond of software engineering since my school years. I played a lot
with Pascal, C, and C++ at that time. The first programming language that I have
learnt professionally was JavaScript. This gave me enough knowledge for
the development of a web browser game where you need to fight against
a computer opponent. It was a lovely time and I was so happy with
making all these animations on the previously static web page. Later I found that
you can not create server code using JavaScript (there was no NodeJS at that time)
and it was very disappointing. The funny thing there is that I learned the term “server”
by having a very practical purpose of adding a multiplayer for my small
JavaScript game.</p>
<p>In 2005 I’ve started my first year at the university. It was a state technical
university, the faculty of electronics and computer science. In parallel, I found
a part-time job in a local company that designed and manufactured electronic
security hardware for the CIS automotive industry. This job was a very good practice of
what I studied in the university – I had a chance to get production experience
with soldering iron, oscillographs, a lot of specific electronic components,
PIC microcontrollers, etc.</p>
<p>In 2007 I have earned my first $50 as a software engineer. By the way, I
got my first money as a software engineer using JavaScript. I found this
experience interesting and start to cooperate with local software engineering
companies on a part-time basis.</p>
<p>In 2010 I have successfully graduated from university as an Electronics Engineer.
By that time I have already had few years of commercial experience as a software engineer,
and there was plenty of work, so I decided to continue my career as a software engineer.</p>
<p>My further career continued in international product and service companies.
In 2013 I joined Cupid, in 2015 – SoftServe, in 2017 – Portside, and in 2019 I moved
to the U.S. as a SoftServe Technical Leader.</p>
<p>Nowadays I keep working as a Technical Leader, lead my open-source projects,
help other engineers as a mentor, conduct technical interviews, and don’t miss
a chance to contribute to the IT industry when I see that I could help.</p>
<p>Do what you love, and get things done well – that’s my credo and best
recommendation to anybody of you.</p>
