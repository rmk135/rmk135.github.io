Books
=====

I am a software engineer, I like my profession and I really like to read 
about software engineering. I prefer to read fundamental books that are less 
about particular language and more about something common, like design 
patterns, refactoring, architecture, work process, industry's best practices, 
values and principles of software engineering. 

It doesn't mean that I don't like to read about programming languages, I do 
remember how interesting and exciting was reading of K&R "The C Programming 
Language", but as for now fundamental things are preferrable. 

My favorite authors: are Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Steve McConnell and 
Robert C. Martin.

Every time I read a book about software engineering I write a small review 
on it. I recently found this practice very interesting and useful. The most 
beneficial thing I get is a structuring of obtained knowledge. I remember how 
sometimes I caught myself thinking that I read about something really 
interesting, but I can't remember some important details. Practice of making 
these small reviews helps to mitigate such things - in such cases I go back 
to such chapters and read them again.
