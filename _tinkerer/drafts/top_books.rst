Top Books
=========

I am a software engineer, I like my profession and I really like to read 
about it. Every time I read a book about software engineering I write a small 
review. I find this process rather useful and interesting. It helps me to
structurise obtained knowledge. On this page I host a list of links to such
reviews that form a small top of books that I recommend to Python developers.
