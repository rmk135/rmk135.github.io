New book in My Library - TRIZ: The Innovation Algorithm by Genrich Altshuller
================================================================================

Ideal object is an object that doesn't exist but its function is performed.

This is a phrase that I'll remember for the rest of my life.

Level of invention
------------------

Level 1
~~~~~~~

Routine design problems solved by methods well known within the specialty. Usually no invention
needed.

Example: use of coal for writing.

Level 2
~~~~~~~

Minor improvements to an existing system using methods known within the industry.

Example: graphite pencil (wrapped coal stick).

Level 3
~~~~~~~

Fundamental improvement to an existing system using methods known outside the industry.

Example: ink pen (ink instead of coal).

Level 4
~~~~~~~

A new generation of a system that entails a new principle for performing the system's primary
functions. Solutions are found more often in science than technology.

Example: printer (another whole system for writing).

Level 5
~~~~~~~

A rare scientific discovery or pioneering invention of an essentially new system.
example: electronic pen & paper (see `_Anoto <https://www.anoto.com/>`).
