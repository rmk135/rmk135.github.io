New book in My Library - Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code (2nd Edition) by Martin Fowler
==========================================================================================================

Being a huge fan of refactoring I couldn't miss 2nd edition of Martin Fowler's "Refactoring"
from my radar.

It was announced in the mid of Mar 2018 with 2 main features - less class-oriented and JavaScript
as a language for examples. I would say nothing if I say that I was surprised and intrigued. I
think Martin did very right decision here - he has decided to show The World how 20-years-old
rules still keep doing their great job.

I'm done with this fascinating reading and would be glad to share some feedback and thoughts
about this book.
