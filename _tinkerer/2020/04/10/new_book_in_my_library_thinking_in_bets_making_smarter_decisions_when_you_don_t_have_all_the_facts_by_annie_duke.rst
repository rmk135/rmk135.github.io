I've made a list of 5 simple rules for myself:

1. Commit to truth-seeking
2. Beware of the biases
3. Feel when on tilt
4. Time-travel
5. Don't Letterman people

Some of the biases:

- `Resulting (or Outcome) bias <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_bias>`_
- `Motivated reasoning bias <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning>`_
- `Hindsight bias <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias>`_
- `Self-serving bias <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias>`_
- `And more <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases>`_

Must read.
