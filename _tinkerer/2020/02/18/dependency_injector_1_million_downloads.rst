Today `Dependency Injector`_ has passed the barrier of **1 Million downloads** from PyPI (following
the `PePy Tech`_). It is an another Big Day for me and ETS Labs.

.. more::

*Dependency Injector* is a dependency injection microframework for Python.
It was designed to be a unified and developer-friendly tool that helps
implement a dependency injection design pattern in a formal, pretty, and
Pythonic way.

I keep using it since 2015 when it was open-sourced and I feel really excited that people get
more and more involved in the idea of using dependency injection in Python applications.

As of now `Dependency Injector`_ is:

+ First three places on request "python dependency injection" in Google search results
+ 643 stars, 37 forks, 33 watchers, 174 closed issues, 45 closed pull requests & 9 contributors on
  GitHub.
+ 38k+ / month downloads from PyPI
+ 2.5k+ / month documentation visits
+ 156 releases
+ 1,203 commits
+ Support of Python 3.8, 3.7, 3.6, 3.5, 3.4, 2.7, as well as PyPy and PyPy3

Thanks a lot to all
