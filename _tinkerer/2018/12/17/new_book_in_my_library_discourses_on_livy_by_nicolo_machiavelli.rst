New book in My Library - Discourses on Livy by Nicolo Machiavelli
=================================================================

The way "Discources on Livy" has got in my hands is fairly simple - I was
very inspired by "The Prince" by Nicolo Machiavelli and decided to get his
#2 (according to people reviews) book.

Last weekend I've finished its reading and now I would like to share sort of
its summary and what this book meant to me personally.

The book is very well structured. It consists of 3 parts where each part
contains 40 - 50 not very big chapters. At the same time, each chapter is a
complete micro story with a certain summary. Such structure made reading to
be a pleasure cause reading of single chapter took 5 - 15 minutes and it was
very comfortable from the prospective of time planning.

I like simple, short and, at the same time, accurate descriptions that could
be put to a single sentence. Making such description for "Discourages by
Livy" I would say that it's a great retrospective for all known to that time
history (~1500 a.e.) on political, military and social aspects of life with
keeping focus on Rome republic. It also quite tightly coupled with what Nicolo
Machiavelli stated in his "The Prince", but much deeper, as from my
point of view. By the way, the book contains a lot of mentions and links to
different parts of "The Prince".

Talking about what Iâ€™ve found beneficial for myself, I have mostly the same
feelings as after reading "The Prince". While I'm interested in politics,
management and psychology, "Discourses on Livy" gave me a lot of "case study"
knowledge.

I had a chance to rethink different situations of my life through the prism
of this book. It was really funny because very lot of times I caught myself
projecting what I was reading to my own experience.

Making a summary, I would definitely recommend to read this book to people
who are interested in politics, management, business and psychology. I'm sure
that it will be very interesting and useful.

PS: I also would recommend to read "The Prince" first, before getting to
"Discourses on Livy". At least, for me such chaining these two book was just
a perfect order for getting good understanding of described events.
