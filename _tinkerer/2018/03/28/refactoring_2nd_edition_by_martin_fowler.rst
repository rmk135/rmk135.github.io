Refactoring 2nd Edition by Martin Fowler
========================================

Today I have discovered some great news - Martin Fowler announced that he is 
going to release a 2nd edition of one of his most famous books - Refactoring.

I feel really excited about the news, here they are:

1. **Less class-oriented** - more focus on functions.
2. **Examples are in JavaScript** - because it is less class-oriented than 
   Java.
3. **Website-first book** - 1st source of the book is a website, you will 
   get an access key to a website with any copy of the book.
4. **Release in fall 2018** - it's really soon, folks!

Really great news! I will for sure order a website access just once it's 
released.
