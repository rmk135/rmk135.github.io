New book in My Library - Screw It, Let's Do It by Richard Branson
=================================================================

I had a little vacation last week. We with my family decided to move to the
country hotel and and have few quite family days. I was willing to take
something to read with me and was choosing between few books that I wanted to
read recently.

Finally, I stopped my choice on Richard Branson's "Screw It, Let's Do It".

Yesterday evening I've finished its reading, so it's time to share the
impression about this book.

To be short, it was hard to stop reading this book. It's a book about great
person Richard Branson, his way of living, his way of making business, his
principles and values, his nature.

When I started reading, I thought that this book will be all about business,
negotiations, motivation and so on, but how surprised I was when found lots
of adventure stories like crossing Atlantic and Pacific Oceans on a Balloon.
I would like to say a huge "Thank You" to Richard Branson that he put these
stories inside of this book, because without them it would be hard to explain
his real nature, principles and values.

This book describes Richard's life and how he dealt with different not so
easy situations during it, how he found motivation for doing great things and
created a group of companies ("Virgin") that move the World to better future.

I was really happy to find a quite good advice on how person can combine their
personal life with their business, principles and values in a single complete
way. The story of Richard Branson is on of the great examples of doing this.

I do recommend "Screw It, Let's Do It" by Richard Branson to you, Friends.
Richard Branson will give you quite few very important advice on your life.
