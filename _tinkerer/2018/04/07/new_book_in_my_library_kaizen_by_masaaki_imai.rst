New book in My Library - Kaizen by Masaaki Imai 
================================================

Few days ago I have finished reading one really great book - 
"Kaizen: The Key To Japan's Competitive Success" by Masaaki Imai.

It was one that I was super interested in. Some time ago I have realized that 
I know to less about eastern culture of management. Most of my knowledge and 
experience was related to work with American companies, so I have decided to 
get this corrected and bought few books about eastern management principles 
and culture - "Kaizen" was one of those.

Talking about the book - itâ€™s awesome :) I was very impressed by TQC (Total 
Quality Control) strategy and  graceful victories that were achieved with its 
help. Now I also have better understanding of TPM (Total Productive 
Maintainence), "Just-in-Time" / "Just-in-Case" production systems and a lot 
of other quite interesting management and production approaches.

Another thing that I really loved about this book is that it contains quite 
descriptive diagrams. I personally perceive information better (and faster) 
when it is visually represented (diagrams, schemas etc). 

Making a conclusion, I really recommend "Kaizen" by Masaaki Imai to you, 
Friends.
