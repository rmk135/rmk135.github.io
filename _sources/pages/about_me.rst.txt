Hello,

My name is Roman. I am software engineer and I have started my personal 
website for having a chance to share some of my professional experience and 
thoughts about software engineering. I like high quality solutions, so my 
credo - "Done, when done well" - can describe me the best way. I like to 
make things work smart and comprehensive way, at the same time keeping 
certain level of simplicity, clearence and structuring. Once I have 
found that my strength area is to make complex things to be simpler - and now 
I keep moving that way. I hope that you will find information on my website 
useful and interesting.

My Experience
-------------

+ I am software engineer with 10+ years of commercial experience.
+ I specialise on engineering of web backend applications and reusable 
  software - libraries and frameworks.
+ I lead small non-profitable organisation that specialises on engineering 
  of reusable open-source software (libraries and frameworks) for Python - 
  `ETS Labs`_.
+ I use Python as main programming language. My secondary programming 
  languages are Cython, C and JavaScript. I have some experience in PHP - I 
  used it in the beginning of my software engineering career.
+ I have experience of technical leading 2 small software engineering 
  cross-functional teams (< 10 people) for large commercial product companies.
+ I work as technical interviewer and knowledge evaluator for large Ukrainian 
  IT outsourcing company. I have conducted more than 100 of technical 
  interviews for software engineers according to corporate knowledge model 
  and standards.
+ I read fundamental books about software engineering written by 
  Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Steve McConnell and Robert C. Martin.

My Way
------

I've been fond of software engineering from my school years. I played a lot 
with Pascal, C, and C++ that times. First programming language that I have 
learnt well enough was JavaScript. This gave me enough knowledge for 
development of small web browser turn-based game where you fight against very 
primitive computer opponent. It was lovely times and I was so happy with 
making all these animations on previously static web page. Later I found that 
you can not create server using JavaScript (there was no NodeJS that times)
and it was very disapointing. Funny thing there is that I learnt term "server"
by having a very practical purpose of adding a multiplayer for my small 
JavaScript game.

In 2005 I've attended university. It was local technical university, faculty 
of electronics and computers. In parallel, I found part-time job in not so 
big local company that designed and manufactured electronic security devices 
for Ukrainian and Russing auto industry. This job was a very good practice of 
what I was studying in university - I had a chance get production practice 
with soldering iron, oscilographs, a lot of specific electronic components, 
microcontrollers like PIC and so on.

In 2007 I have earned my first $50 as software developer. By the way, I 
earned my first money as a software developer using JavaScript. I found this 
experience interesting and start cooperate with small local software 
engineering companies on part-time basis.

In 2010 I have successfully graduated from university with a degree 
"engineer of electronics". By that time I have already had few years of 
experience in software engineering, so I decided to continue my career as 
software engineer.

Nowadays I keep working as a software engineer, love my work and feel 
absolutely sure that I did a right choice.
