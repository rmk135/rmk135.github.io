Hey,

My name is Roman. I am a software engineer. I started this website to share
some of my professional experience in software engineering, interesting books,
and lifestyle events. I like high-load systems, domain-driven design, clean code,
refactoring, asynchronous programming, and generally everything about creating software.
My professional credo – "Done, when done well". I like to make things work smart
and comprehensive way, at the same time being simple, clear, and well-structured.

My Experience
-------------

+ I am a software engineer with 14 years of commercial experience.
+ I specialize in engineering backend applications and reusable
  libraries and frameworks.
+ I found and lead `ETS Labs`_. This is an engineering organization that specializes
  in creating Python software.
+ I created the `Dependency Injector <https://github.com/ets-labs/python-dependency-injector>`_.
  It's a dependency injection framework for Python.
  It has become one of the most popular Python dependency injection frameworks.
+ I mentor other software engineers helping to promote their careers, structure the knowledge,
  and develop new skills. My partner and I created `MentorBot <https://t.me/devmentorbot>`_.
  It's a Telegram bot that helps software engineers to find mentors.
+ I use Python as the main programming language. I also have some experience with
  Cython and C. I also used PHP and Javascript at the beginning of my software
  engineering career.
+ I have experience in technical leading software engineering
  cross-functional teams for international product and service companies,
  as well as experience working in a startup as a first backend engineer.
+ I worked as a technical interviewer and help companies to hire Python software engineers.
  I have conducted over 250 technical interviews.
+ I like to read books about software engineering. My favorite authors are
  Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Steve McConnell, Robert C. Martin, and other
  known experts in the field of software design.

My Career
---------

I've been fond of software engineering since my school years. I played a lot
with Pascal, C, and C++ at that time. The first programming language that I have
learnt professionally was JavaScript. This gave me enough knowledge for
the development of a web browser game where you need to fight against
a computer opponent. It was a lovely time and I was so happy with
making all these animations on the previously static web page. Later I found that
you can not create server code using JavaScript (there was no NodeJS at that time)
and it was very disappointing. The funny thing there is that I learned the term "server"
by having a very practical purpose of adding a multiplayer for my small 
JavaScript game.

In 2005 I've started my first year at the university. It was a state technical
university, the faculty of electronics and computer science. In parallel, I found
a part-time job in a local company that designed and manufactured electronic
security hardware for the CIS automotive industry. This job was a very good practice of
what I studied in the university – I had a chance to get production experience
with soldering iron, oscillographs, a lot of specific electronic components,
PIC microcontrollers, etc.

In 2007 I have earned my first $50 as a software engineer. By the way, I
got my first money as a software engineer using JavaScript. I found this
experience interesting and start to cooperate with local software engineering
companies on a part-time basis.

In 2010 I have successfully graduated from university as an Electronics Engineer.
By that time I have already had few years of commercial experience as a software engineer,
and there was plenty of work, so I decided to continue my career as a software engineer.

My further career continued in international product and service companies.
In 2013 I joined Cupid, in 2015 – SoftServe, in 2017 – Portside, and in 2019 I moved
to the U.S. as a SoftServe Technical Leader.

Nowadays I keep working as a Technical Leader, lead my open-source projects,
help other engineers as a mentor, conduct technical interviews, and don't miss
a chance to contribute to the IT industry when I see that I could help.

Do what you love, and get things done well – that's my credo and best
recommendation to anybody of you.
