Hello, World!

My name is Roman Mogilatov, I'm software engineer, I love Python and I'm 
starting my personal blog. This is a first post I make in my blog and it's 
intended to describe blog's structure and content.

working on in my spare time - :ref:`page_my_projects`.

Top Books
---------
I am a software engineer, I like my profession and I really like to read 
about it. I prefer to read fundamental books that are less about particular 
language and more about something common, like design patterns, refactoring,
architecture, software development lifecycle, work process, industry best
practices, values and principles of software engineering. I also like to read
about programming languages, I do remember how interesting and exciting was
reading of K&R "The C Programming Language", but as for now fundamental
things are preferrable.

My favorite authors: are Martin Fowler, Kent Beck, Steve McConnell and
Robert C. Martin.

Every time I read a book about software engineering I write a small review
on it. I recently found this practice very interesting and useful. The most
beneficial thing I get is a structuring of obtained knowledge. I remember how
sometimes I caught myself thinking that I read about something really
interesting, but I can't remember some important details. Practice of making
these small reviews helps to mitigate such things - when I realise that I'm
not clear with something that I've read, I go back to such chapters and read
them again.

Sometimes people ask me to give recommendations on books that they could 
read for getting better in software engineering.

Long story short, I decided to post these book reviews in my blog to make 
them be available to other people. In addition to this I plan to host my own
top of books about software engineering - :ref:`page_about_me`.
