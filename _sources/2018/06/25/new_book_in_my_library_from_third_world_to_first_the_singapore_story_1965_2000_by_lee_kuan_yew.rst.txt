Lee Kuan Yew is definitely an extraordinary person, outstanding leader and
true patriot of Singapore. I was completely absorbed in this great story and
great book.

This book came to my hands as a part of initiative of discovering eastern
culture and did its job pretty well.

If one would ask me to describe this book in a single sentence, I would say
next:

    It contains description of hundreds of effective and elegant key decisions
    that were made by a great leader and true patriot in a quite toxic
    environment for forming highly-valuable modern 1st World state.

Another good thing about this book is that it contains a quite full
description of Lee Kuan Yew’s analysis that was done before and after making
his elegant decisions. This dive into his thoughts provides quite transparent
vision on eastern way of thinking and what he calls "Confucian values".

It also could be a nice guide on history of all countries of South Eastern
region during 1950 - 2000 years. Lee Kuan Yew had to deal a lot with Malaysia,
Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Philippines, India, Japan, Australia and other
countries of the region. Moreover, it's quite interesting to read about how
international relations with United States, Europe and Soviet Union of that
epoch.

    History, politics, international relations, management, business,
    investment, culture, just human relations, no matter what, I'm sure that
    everybody would get something personally interesting from this book.

I do recommend "From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000"
by Lee Kuan Yew to you, Friends.

You'll definitely enjoy it.
