I've finished reading Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand.

|

It's a mindset changing book. I've found a lot of familiar ideas that I was hard to formulate. I
have experienced some of the described situations and have met some of the characters in real
life.

|

I don't say that this book is a life guide for everyone. I don't say its an ultimate truth. It's
something to know, think and make you own impression about.

The Oath of John Galt
---------------------

I liked the oath of John Galt's oath. I keep recall it on my life journey. Leave it here for
myself:

    "I swear -- by my life and my love of it -- that I will never live for the sake of another
    man, nor ask another man to live for mine."

Finally
-------

Definitely recommend to read the book.

I would also like to discuss the book with the other readers. Leave you comments for conversation.
