Selector provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Selector`` provider selects provider based on the configuration value or other callable.

The idea of ``Selector`` provider was brought up at the issue
`#239 <https://github.com/ets-labs/python-dependency-injector/issues/239>`_. It was brought up
by `Markus Leuthold (githubkusi) <https://github.com/githubkusi>`_. Thanks to Markus for his
contribution.

.. code-block:: python

    from dependency_injector import providers


    class SomeClass:
        ...


    class SomeOtherClass:
        ...


    config = providers.Configuration()

    selector = providers.Selector(
        config.one_or_another,
        one=providers.Factory(SomeClass),
        another=providers.Factory(SomeOtherClass),
    )

    config.override({'one_or_another': 'one'})
    instance_1 = selector()
    assert isinstance(instance_1, SomeClass)

    config.override({'one_or_another': 'another'})
    instance_2 = selector()
    assert isinstance(instance_2, SomeOtherClass)
