New book in My Library - Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software by Eric Evans
=========================================================================================================

"The Blue Book" got on my library's bookshelf. Domain-Driven Design is one of the best-sellers
in the world of books about software engineering.

I have heard about Domain-Driven Design (DDD) a while ago and did like this approach a lot.
However, I need to admire that my understanding of DDD was kind of superficial before I read the
full version of the book.

The cool thing with this reading was that I was engineering one product with quite interesting
domain logic and some DDD patterns did a great job helping design and implement some kind of
behaviour that could potentially lead to quite twisted solution. As a result, final design was
sophisticated, but the code wasn't twisted and it was quite clear how it works and what are the
ways to extend it.

As I usually do, I'm going to share some of my impression I got from this reading and also put a
couple of thoughts about DDD from my current experience.
