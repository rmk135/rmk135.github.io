            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Refactoring 2nd Edition by Martin Fowler</h1>
<p>Today I have discovered some great news - Martin Fowler announced that he is
going to release a 2nd edition of one of his most famous books - Refactoring.</p>
<p>I feel really excited about the news, here they are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Less class-oriented</strong> - more focus on functions.</li>
<li><strong>Examples are in JavaScript</strong> - because it is less class-oriented than
Java.</li>
<li><strong>Website-first book</strong> - 1st source of the book is a website, you will
get an access key to a website with any copy of the book.</li>
<li><strong>Release in fall 2018</strong> - it’s really soon, folks!</li>
</ol>

<p>Really great news! I will for sure order a website access just once it’s
released.</p>
