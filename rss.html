            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by GoF - Gang of Four</h1>
<p>I’ve done with reading another great book about fundamentals of software engineering - Design
Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by GoF - Gang of Four - Erich Gamma,
Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2019/05/22/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51szD9HC9pL._SX395_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51szD9HC9pL._SX395_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51szD9HC9pL._SX395_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>Amazon says that this book is #1 Best Seller in category “Software Reuse”. Could I miss it,
feeling so passionate about this topic? No way, friends, no way. I feel really happy that this
book has appeared on my bookshelf and I’m hurrying to share some feedback with you.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems by Sam Newman</h1>
<p>In the beginning of March I’ve finished reading one of the books that I
wanted to get a plenty of time - it is “Building Microservices: Designing
Fine-Grained Systems” by Sam Newman.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2019/04/08/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51m85J4Zi9L.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51m85J4Zi9L.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51m85J4Zi9L.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>I was going to share my feedback on it much earlier (all my time was
taken by relocation to North Carolina), but today is The Day for doing it and
I want to share some feedback about this reading and also give some
recommendations to people whom are going to read it as well.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Discourses on Livy by Nicolo Machiavelli</h1>
<p>The way “Discources on Livy” has got in my hands is fairly simple - I was
very inspired by “The Prince” by Nicolo Machiavelli and decided to get his
#2 (according to people reviews) book.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/12/17/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417XDesB1iL.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417XDesB1iL.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417XDesB1iL.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>Last weekend I’ve finished its reading and now I would like to share sort of
its summary and what this book meant to me personally.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - The Prince by Nicolo Machiavelli</h1>
<p>I’ve settled a new inhabitant to my bookshelf - it is “The Prince” by
Nicolo Machiavelli.</p>
<p>This book was recommended to me by my friend Vadim Tikanov as a “Must Read”
thing few years ago, but while I’ve been reading more technical things that
time this recommendation was left without proper attention.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/11/20/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41i4ERCISDL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41i4ERCISDL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41i4ERCISDL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>Once, walking through a book shop and trying to pick something for my
older daughter, my sight has stopped on a familiar title - The Prince, and
familiar author - Nicolo Machiavelli…</p>
<p>I’ve finished its reading on last weekend, so, as usual, I would like to
share my impression on this book.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Screw It, Let’s Do It by Richard Branson</h1>
<p>I had a little vacation last week. We with my family decided to move to the
country hotel and and have few quite family days. I was willing to take
something to read with me and was choosing between few books that I wanted to
read recently.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/11/05/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SdOPQNKhL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SdOPQNKhL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SdOPQNKhL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>Finally, I stopped my choice on Richard Branson’s “Screw It, Let’s Do It”.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I’ve finished its reading, so it’s time to share the
impression about this book.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 by Lee Kuan Yew</h1>
<p>My library has been replenished with another one great book. It is “From Third
World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000” by Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/06/25/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qLl7jTeEL._SX341_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qLl7jTeEL._SX341_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qLl7jTeEL._SX341_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>Lee Kuan Yew is definitely an extraordinary person, outstanding leader and
true patriot of Singapore. I was completely absorbed in this great story and
great book.</p>
<p>This book came to my hands as a part of initiative of discovering eastern
culture and did its job pretty well.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Kaizen by Masaaki Imai</h1>
<p>Few days ago I have finished reading one really great book -
“Kaizen: The Key To Japan’s Competitive Success” by Masaaki Imai.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/04/07/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yMINmHOZL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yMINmHOZL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yMINmHOZL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>It was one that I was super interested in. Some time ago I have realized that
I know to less about eastern culture of management. Most of my knowledge and
experience was related to work with American companies, so I have decided to
get this corrected and bought few books about eastern management principles
and culture - “Kaizen” was one of those.</p>
