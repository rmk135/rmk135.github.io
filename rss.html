<p>I’ve finished reading Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art by Steve McConnell.</p>
<p>One of the respected software engineers recommended it to me. Cool stuff. I recommend to read it to you too.
You’ll become a better estimator and will know how to communicate to your boss with less stress.</p>

<p>I’ve finished reading Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br/></div>
</div>
<p>It’s a mindset changing book. I’ve found a lot of familiar ideas that I was hard to formulate. I
have experienced some of the described situations and have met some of the characters in real
life.</p>

<p>I don’t say that this book is a life guide for everyone. I don’t say its an ultimate truth. It’s

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ets-labs/python-dependency-injector">Dependency Injector</a> 3.15 has been released. This release adds a support of Python 3.8 &amp; PyPy 3,
as well as widens the list of compatible versions of <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">six</span></span> library with its 1.13.0 and 1.14.0
releases.</p>
<p>This release also is a beginning of soft and gentle wiping out of Python 2. In particular, all
examples were rewritten to stop doing Python 2-ish inheritance from <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">object</span></span> and start calling
parent methods in Python 3-ish way.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering by Brooks Jr., Frederick P</h1>
<p>“The Mythical Man-Month” (MM-M) has become part of my library.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2019/09/10/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WIpM70FEL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WIpM70FEL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WIpM70FEL._SX334_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>You, probably, have already heard a lot about this book. It was originally published in 1975. The
only fact that it stays actual 44 years after says quite a lot about it. It is super famous in
software engineering environment and, probably, could be called nowadays software engineering
literature classics.</p>
<p>This book reveals to us some pieces of story of building IBM/360 &amp; OS/360. Mr. Brooks was
playing a role of project manager for both of them. I have remembered one of his phrases that
has deeply settled in my mind - “I’m writing to you from a prospective of project manager that
did several multi-million dollar mistakes”. It’s hard to imagine the level of responsibility and
pressure that was put on his shoulders that time.</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to share some of my thoughts regarding this book.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software by Eric Evans</h1>
<p>“The Blue Book” got on my library’s bookshelf. Domain-Driven Design is one of the best-sellers
in the world of books about software engineering.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2019/08/02/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sZW87slRL._SX375_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sZW87slRL._SX375_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sZW87slRL._SX375_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>I have heard about Domain-Driven Design (DDD) a while ago and did like this approach a lot.
However, I need to admire that my understanding of DDD was kind of superficial before I read the
full version of the book.</p>
<p>The cool thing with this reading was that I was engineering one product with quite interesting
domain logic and some DDD patterns did a great job helping design and implement some kind of
behaviour that could potentially lead to quite twisted solution. As a result, final design was
sophisticated, but the code wasn’t twisted and it was quite clear how it works and what are the
ways to extend it.</p>
<p>As I usually do, I’m going to share my impression I got from this reading.</p>

<p>Today is a Big Day for me and for ETS Labs and the reason for this is that ETS Labs main project
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ets-labs/python-dependency-injector">Dependency Injector</a> today reached
<strong>500 stars</strong> on GitHub.</p>

<p>Dependency Injector is a dependency injection microframework for Python. It was designed to be
unified, developer-friendly tool that helps to implement dependency injection design pattern in
formal, pretty, Pythonic way.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code (2nd Edition) by Martin Fowler</h1>
<p>Being a huge fan of refactoring I couldn’t miss 2nd edition of Martin Fowler’s “Refactoring”
from my radar. Today this wonderful book took its deserved place on my bookshelf for read books.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2019/06/12/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41LBzpPXCOL._SX379_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41LBzpPXCOL._SX379_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41LBzpPXCOL._SX379_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>It was announced in the mid of Mar 2018 with 2 main features - less class-oriented and JavaScript
as a language for examples. I would say nothing if I say that I was surprised and intrigued. I
think Martin did very right decision here - he has decided to show The World how 20-years-old
rules still keep doing their great job.</p>
<p>I’m done with this fascinating reading and would be glad to share some feedback and thoughts
about this book.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by GoF - Gang of Four</h1>
<p>I’ve done with reading another great book about fundamentals of software engineering - Design
Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by GoF - Gang of Four - Erich Gamma,
Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2019/05/22/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51szD9HC9pL._SX395_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51szD9HC9pL._SX395_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51szD9HC9pL._SX395_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>Amazon says that this book is #1 Best Seller in category “Software Reuse”. Could I miss it,
feeling so passionate about this topic? No way, friends, no way. I feel really happy that this
book has appeared on my bookshelf and I’m hurrying to share some feedback with you.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems by Sam Newman</h1>
<p>In the beginning of March I’ve finished reading one of the books that I
wanted to get a plenty of time - it is “Building Microservices: Designing
Fine-Grained Systems” by Sam Newman.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2019/04/08/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51m85J4Zi9L.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51m85J4Zi9L.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51m85J4Zi9L.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>I was going to share my feedback on it much earlier (all my time was
taken by relocation to North Carolina), but today is The Day for doing it and
I want to share some feedback about this reading and also give some
recommendations to people whom are going to read it as well.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Discourses on Livy by Nicolo Machiavelli</h1>
<p>The way “Discources on Livy” has got in my hands is fairly simple - I was
very inspired by “The Prince” by Nicolo Machiavelli and decided to get his
#2 (according to people reviews) book.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/12/17/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417XDesB1iL.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417XDesB1iL.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/417XDesB1iL.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>Last weekend I’ve finished its reading and now I would like to share sort of
its summary and what this book meant to me personally.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - The Prince by Nicolo Machiavelli</h1>
<p>I’ve settled a new inhabitant to my bookshelf - it is “The Prince” by
Nicolo Machiavelli.</p>
<p>This book was recommended to me by my friend Vadim Tikanov as a “Must Read”
thing few years ago, but while I’ve been reading more technical things that
time this recommendation was left without proper attention.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/11/20/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41i4ERCISDL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41i4ERCISDL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41i4ERCISDL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>Once, walking through a book shop and trying to pick something for my
older daughter, my sight has stopped on a familiar title - The Prince, and
familiar author - Nicolo Machiavelli…</p>
<p>I’ve finished its reading on last weekend, so, as usual, I would like to
share my impression on this book.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Screw It, Let’s Do It by Richard Branson</h1>
<p>I had a little vacation last week. We with my family decided to move to the
country hotel and and have few quite family days. I was willing to take
something to read with me and was choosing between few books that I wanted to
read recently.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/11/05/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SdOPQNKhL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SdOPQNKhL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51SdOPQNKhL._SX322_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>Finally, I stopped my choice on Richard Branson’s “Screw It, Let’s Do It”.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I’ve finished its reading, so it’s time to share the
impression about this book.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 by Lee Kuan Yew</h1>
<p>My library has been replenished with another one great book. It is “From Third
World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000” by Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/06/25/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qLl7jTeEL._SX341_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qLl7jTeEL._SX341_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qLl7jTeEL._SX341_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>Lee Kuan Yew is definitely an extraordinary person, outstanding leader and
true patriot of Singapore. I was completely absorbed in this great story and
great book.</p>
<p>This book came to my hands as a part of initiative of discovering eastern
culture and did its job pretty well.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Kaizen by Masaaki Imai</h1>
<p>Few days ago I have finished reading one really great book -
“Kaizen: The Key To Japan’s Competitive Success” by Masaaki Imai.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/04/07/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yMINmHOZL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yMINmHOZL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yMINmHOZL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>It was one that I was super interested in. Some time ago I have realized that
I know to less about eastern culture of management. Most of my knowledge and
experience was related to work with American companies, so I have decided to
get this corrected and bought few books about eastern management principles
and culture - “Kaizen” was one of those.</p>
