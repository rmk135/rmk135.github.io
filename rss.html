            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Screw It, Let’s Do It by Richard Branson</h1>
<p>I had a little vacation last week. We with my family decided to move to the
country hotel and and have few quite family days. I was willing to take
something to read with me and was choosing between few books that I wanted to
read recently.</p>

<p>Finally, I stopped my choice on Richard Branson’s “Screw It, Let’s Do It”.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I’ve finished its reading, so it’s time to share the
impression about this book.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - From Third World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000 by Lee Kuan Yew</h1>
<p>My library has been replenished with another one great book. It is “From Third
World to First: The Singapore Story - 1965-2000” by Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/06/25/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qLl7jTeEL._SX341_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qLl7jTeEL._SX341_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qLl7jTeEL._SX341_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>Lee Kuan Yew is definitely an extraordinary person, outstanding leader and
true patriot of Singapore. I was completely absorbed in this great story and
great book.</p>
<p>This book came to my hands as a part of initiative of discovering eastern
culture and did its job pretty well.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>New book in My Library - Kaizen by Masaaki Imai</h1>
<p>Few days ago I have finished reading one really great book -
“Kaizen: The Key To Japan’s Competitive Success” by Masaaki Imai.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="https://romanmogilatov.com/2018/04/07/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yMINmHOZL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"><img alt="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yMINmHOZL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" class="align-left" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yMINmHOZL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" style="width: 200px;"/></a>
<p>It was one that I was super interested in. Some time ago I have realized that
I know to less about eastern culture of management. Most of my knowledge and
experience was related to work with American companies, so I have decided to
get this corrected and bought few books about eastern management principles
and culture - “Kaizen” was one of those.</p>
